# CHECKER'S  GAME
THIS REPOSITORY CONSTAINS A SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION OF CHECKER'S GAME DONE IN PYTHON. THIS IMPLMENTATION USES A USER TEXT INTERFACE. THE MOVES ARE DONE BY ENTERING THE COORDINATES OF THE INITIAL AND FINAL POSITION OF THE PIECES.


THE CURRENT PROJECT AS IT STANDS, HAS A LITTLE PROBLEM IN THE LOGIC IN MAIN LOOP. EVERY FUNCTIONALITY WAS TESTED IN THE MAIN FILE PROGRAM AND IT WORKS FINE STANDALONE, BUT IN ASSEMBLING THESE TOGETHER FUNCTIONALITIES IN THE MAIN LOOP THERE'S SOME LOGICAL SEQUENCE MISTAKES. ANY HELP IN THIS REGARD WILL BE ENTIRELY WELLCOME.


THE PRESENT PROJECT WAS DONE AS AN EXERCISE IN LOGICAL PROGRAMMING
